** Usage
Copy ~html-colors.ini~ into your ~.ini~ folder, typically ~{project-root}/data/config~ and include it from your main ~.ini~ file.

After include you can refer to color name directly by e.g. ~@Colors.MediumOrchid~.

 #+BEGIN_SRC ini
@html-colors.ini@

[Object]
Color           = @Colors.MediumOrchid
 #+END_SRC




** Cool... but why?
It is good when your editor supports visualization of colors and you can prototype without need for switching into painting program with color picker tool.
It gives you an option to use colors by their names instead of using those pesky vectors directly.


*** Example
This image shows color highlighting in  /Emacs/ with /rainbow-mode/ enabled.
