** Usage
Copy ~html-colors.ini~ into your ~.ini~ folder, typically ~{project-root}/data/config~ and include from your main ~.ini~ file like this:
 #+BEGIN_SRC ini

@html-colors.ini@

[Object]
Color           = @Colors.MediumOrchid
 #+END_SRC

After include you can refer to color name directly by e.g. ~@Colors.MediumOrchid~.


** Cool... but why?
It is good when your editor supports visualization of HTML colors. You can prototype without need for switching into painting program with color picker tool.
It gives you an option to use colors by their names instead of using thos pesky vectors directly.
